# How to work with JavaScript Promises

This is project is to help you learn how to use promises and avoid callbacks.
In the past callbacks was the solution to handle/implement asynchronous behaviour iin JavaScript.

But the callback code is always hard to debug and maintain because it's difficult to read and understand.

### Synchronous Behaviour

This is behaviour JavaScript executes code line by line.

1. Open synchronous.html in the browser and check your console.
2. Open synchronous.js in your code editor
3. You will see that the output in the console is exactly in the order the code was written.
